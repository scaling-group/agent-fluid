# Dogfish L64 3D Moving-Window Still-Water Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 40-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. Its logical Phase-2 population is always four workers even when the
  four CFD evaluations are mapped across different PBS/GPU allocations.
- The fixed task is WaterLily 3D at `L64`, `Re=1000`, target `(9,9.5)L`,
  first-crossing radius `0.75L`, still water `U_infinity=0`, direct uniform
  initialization without prewarm, released horizon `100T`, a `24L x 16L`
  inertial virtual field stored in a `4L x 3L x 1.5L` moving window, and the
  actuator envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive seed has only a state-feedback oscillator and posterior
  phase lag. It reads joint state but not the task target, flow, force, moment,
  world position, learned route, or any external phase signal, and it is not
  intended to complete the task.
- In the direct-uniform seed rollout, the alternating top-down wake and oblique
  Lambda2 structures show genuine self-propulsion, and joint angles stay near
  `26 deg`, yet heading ranges from about `+0.60` to `-1.17 rad`: distance only
  improves from `12.3277L` to `12.0638L` transiently before a `left_domain`
  exit at `8.613T` and `12.3510L`. The same trace touches the velocity limit on
  `4.0%` of rows and exceeds the raw acceleration envelope on `52.6%`, so a
  coherent wake proves self-propulsion but not efficient control authority.
  For this failure topology, preserve the joint-state traveling-bend structure
  and first add bounded body-frame
  target-vector-to-mean-curvature feedback rather than retuning propulsion.
  This implication applies when a coherent wake and finite translation are
  visible without target alignment; falsify it if the added curvature turns
  with the wrong sign, destroys wake coherence, worsens saturation, or leaves
  the same exit topology and distance record; do not answer a failed turn by
  blindly increasing already actuator-heavy propulsion.
- Do not assume that the same mean-offset sign has the same yaw effect at both
  joints. In the sampled direct-uniform rollouts, a positive posterior-only
  offset preserved a coherent wake and improved the final/minimum distance to
  `11.0960L`, but swept through zero bearing into the upper boundary while
  exceeding the acceleration envelope on `72.0%` of rows. Equal positive
  `9 deg` anterior/posterior offsets nearly suppressed the carrier
  (`max |phi_dot|=1.27 rad/T`) and worsened final distance to `15.3607L`; a
  positive `8 deg` anterior-centered, slip-aware offset retained propulsion
  and reached the best sampled minimum, `8.1745L`, yet bearing grew toward
  `1.2 rad` and the fish passed below the target before a lower-boundary exit.
  Treat joint placement and measured yaw sign as part of the steering
  mechanism: preserve posterior lag, calibrate anterior and posterior offsets
  separately, and release or reverse curvature using observed turn response.
  This implication applies to coherent-wake bearing sweeps; falsify it if an
  opposite-sign differential allocation fails to correct the turn direction,
  collapses the wake, or does not reduce saturation or boundary-exit severity.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect both top-down and oblique 3D keyframe rows before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination. A prewarm
  artifact is a contract failure in this direct-uniform experiment.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Inflow, target position, initial pose,
  and hydrodynamic conditions are intended held-out axes; coordinate
  memorization is not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
