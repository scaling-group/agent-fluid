# Dogfish L64 3D Moving-Window Still-Water Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 10-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. Its logical Phase-2 population is always four workers even when the
  four CFD evaluations are mapped across different PBS/GPU allocations.
- The fixed task is WaterLily 3D at `L64`, `Re=1000`, target `(9,9.5)L`,
  first-crossing radius `0.75L`, still water `U_infinity=0`, direct uniform
  initialization without prewarm, released horizon `100T`, a `24L x 16L`
  inertial virtual field stored in a `4L x 3L x 1.5L` moving window, and the
  actuator envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive seed has only a state-feedback oscillator and posterior
  phase lag. It reads joint state but not the task target, flow, force, moment,
  world position, learned route, or any external phase signal, and it is not
  intended to complete the task.
- Direct-uniform still-water evidence separates propulsion progress from route
  control. The drive-only seed formed a coherent 3D posterior wake but reached
  only `12.078L` before upper exit. Four inherited shared/partial
  mean-curvature variants then retained `left_domain` and regressed final
  distance to `13.258--15.361L`; do not retry common, shared, or tail-biased
  moving equilibria by scalar gain changes. Anterior useful-half-cycle steering
  instead improved minimum/final distance to `11.782/11.797L`, while posterior
  half-cycle scaling and a shared residual were weaker (`12.006/12.205L` and
  `12.140/12.686L`). A later slip-aware, both-stroke anterior residual retained
  the alternating wake and improved monotonically to `10.062L`, yet all sampled
  variants still hit the `260 deg/T` rate cap and exited the upper boundary. In
  that strongest trace, bearing reversal was followed by opposite joint means
  of about `-0.081/+0.122 rad` near exit because the full biased anterior angle
  entered the `-q1` tail target. Reuse the narrow positive result—body-frame
  slip feedback and anterior steering can preserve thrust and substantially
  improve progress—but do not treat an opposite-mean posterior response or
  more drive gain as directed turning. The subsequent clean separation—an
  anterior-only curvature center with a zero-mean posterior lag—survived this
  test: it retained the alternating top-down and oblique wake for `28.59T`,
  changed the common upper exit to a lower exit, and improved closest approach
  from `10.062L` to `5.033L`. It did not capture: distance rose again to
  `9.084L`, bearing grew from `0.155` to about `1.455 rad` near the miss, and
  `14--20T` means showed saturated-sign anterior curvature
  (`0.143--0.158 rad`) with a near-zero posterior mean while heading barely
  changed. Reuse anterior/tail mean separation as the strongest trajectory
  base, but treat a full-strength posterior carrier during large bearing as a
  concrete failure mode. Later tests sharpen the boundary: symmetric
  bearing-gated tail relief, an added anterior phase residual, posterior
  half-stroke redistribution, and their whole-body combination progressively
  improved closest approach to `4.233L`, `4.018L`, `3.909L`, and `3.691L`,
  yet all preserved the lower-exit topology and still had `1.33--1.41 rad`
  bearing near closest approach. Replacing the folded bearing with the full
  rear-target angle also preserved the failure (`3.909L` minimum,
  `9.320L` final), so post-pass angle semantics alone are not recovery
  authority. Across the sampled sequence, joint-1 acceleration-cap occupancy
  remained about `67.6--67.8%`; an additive steering residual was therefore
  often hidden by the already saturated carrier even when it improved the
  trajectory narrowly. Do not keep stacking steering terms or angle fixes on
  that saturated command. Preserve the coherent separated-mean gait, but test
  explicit actuator-headroom allocation or a lower-demand carrier so target
  feedback can change the released acceleration; falsify this implication if
  the same capped stroke balance, large-bearing pass, or lower exit remains,
  or if the wake, closest approach, rate occupancy, or loads regress.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect both top-down and oblique 3D keyframe rows before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination. A prewarm
  artifact is a contract failure in this direct-uniform experiment.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Inflow, target position, initial pose,
  and hydrodynamic conditions are intended held-out axes; coordinate
  memorization is not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
