# Dogfish L64 3D Moving-Window Still-Water Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 10-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. Its logical Phase-2 population is always four workers even when the
  four CFD evaluations are mapped across different PBS/GPU allocations.
- The fixed task is WaterLily 3D at `L64`, `Re=1000`, target `(9,9.5)L`,
  first-crossing radius `0.75L`, still water `U_infinity=0`, direct uniform
  initialization without prewarm, released horizon `100T`, a `24L x 16L`
  inertial virtual field stored in a `4L x 3L x 1.5L` moving window, and the
  actuator envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive seed has only a state-feedback oscillator and posterior
  phase lag. It reads joint state but not the task target, flow, force, moment,
  world position, learned route, or any external phase signal, and it is not
  intended to complete the task.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect both top-down and oblique 3D keyframe rows before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination. A prewarm
  artifact is a contract failure in this direct-uniform experiment.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Inflow, target position, initial pose,
  and hydrodynamic conditions are intended held-out axes; coordinate
  memorization is not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- In direct-uniform still water, target feedback should leave the anterior
  carrier equilibrium unchanged until contrary evidence appears. Among the
  sampled first-generation policies, posterior-only bearing-plus-trend bias
  retained the coherent alternating 3D wake and improved the seed's
  minimum/final distance from `12.078/12.380L` to `11.413/11.421L`. Centering
  the same kind of bias on both joints instead held joint excursions near
  `10 deg`, delayed visible wake growth, made a broad U-turn, and ended at
  `13.411L`. Apply this lesson to a working traveling-bend carrier; falsify it
  if a future shared-bias design preserves comparable joint/wake amplitude and
  improves target progress rather than merely surviving longer.
- On a working target-versus-course posterior-curvature carrier, phase
  conditioning is useful specifically as attenuation-only wave relief. The
  sampled one-sided policy never amplified the aiding lobe, retained the
  coherent alternating top-down and oblique 3D wake, cut posterior
  acceleration-limit residence from `60.8%` to `35.9%` versus the otherwise
  matching continuous-bias policy, improved closest approach from `6.218L` to
  `5.144L`, and delayed upper exit from `16.879T` to `18.975T`. Do not generalize
  this to arbitrary half-cycle scaling: the inherited two-sided
  strengthen/weaken policy regressed to `11.778L` and `8.800T`, and one-sided
  acceleration-lobe gating reached only `11.448L` at `9.053T`. Preserve the
  successful relief scaffold when testing a response-gated redirect, but do
  not claim steering is solved: its best rollout still passed its closest
  point and exited at center y=`15.203L` with `0.632 U` positive-y velocity.
  Falsify the reusable implication if attenuation loses wake/x progress on a
  different carrier, or if a simpler continuous bias achieves a better
  termination class with comparably low limit residence.
- A speed-reliable, response-gated increase from cruise curvature to a strong
  posterior redirect is now positive evidence, not merely a proposed rescue.
  Applied on the one-sided-relief scaffold above, it preserved the coherent
  alternating top-down and oblique wake and changed the sampled outcome from a
  `5.144L` closest approach plus upper exit at `18.975T` to capture at `0.746L`
  in `16.291T`. The reusable mechanism is to open extra posterior curvature
  only for a large target-versus-course mismatch after forward translation is
  reliable, then release it continuously as measured course realigns. Its cost
  is also material: posterior acceleration-limit residence rose from `35.9%`
  to `60.4%`, despite posterior angle staying within `30.4 deg`. Thus limit
  residence alone must not veto a better termination class, but follow-up
  designs should preserve the evidenced mean redirect while testing whether
  the joint-state wave can yield acceleration headroom. Falsify this transfer
  on carriers without coherent cruise propulsion, or if the stronger redirect
  loses capture/early x progress, fails to release with course response, or
  creates instability rather than a finite target-directed path.
- After that response-gated redirect already captures, treat carrier-phase
  removal as an authority-selection mechanism rather than another steering
  demand. On the same coherent carrier and closing-conditioned approach,
  partially residualizing target-versus-course error with normalized anterior
  joint phase reduced average reconstructed strong-redirect gating from
  `0.226` to `0.145`, advanced capture from `16.225T` to `16.044T`, lowered the
  observed distance integral from `1.32273L` to `1.31388L`, and improved score
  from `-0.06321` to `-0.05831`; top-down and oblique sheets retained the same
  alternating self-propelled wake class. In contrast, adding a bounded bearing
  trend lead or further unloading the terminal wave both returned to
  `16.225T` captures and worse scores (`-0.06551` and `-0.06442`). Thus let a
  phase residual attenuate high-authority duty while the raw body-frame error
  keeps the turn direction; do not infer that more trend prediction or less
  near-target propulsion is beneficial. This comparison applies to a working
  traveling-bend carrier with repeatable beat-synchronous course sway. Falsify
  it if held-out poses decorrelate the joint phase from sway, if the residual
  veto removes a persistent route correction, or if capture, distance
  integral, wake coherence, loads, or limit residence regress.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
