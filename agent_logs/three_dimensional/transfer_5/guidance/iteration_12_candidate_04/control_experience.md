# Dogfish L64 3D Moving-Window Still-Water Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 10-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. Its logical Phase-2 population is always four workers even when the
  four CFD evaluations are mapped across different PBS/GPU allocations.
- The fixed task is WaterLily 3D at `L64`, `Re=1000`, target `(9,9.5)L`,
  first-crossing radius `0.75L`, still water `U_infinity=0`, direct uniform
  initialization without prewarm, released horizon `100T`, a `24L x 16L`
  inertial virtual field stored in a `4L x 3L x 1.5L` moving window, and the
  actuator envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- This lineage starts from the transferred 2D clean-B iteration-20 champion.
  It contains target-aware feedback; evaluate its actual 3D performance rather
  than assuming either successful transfer or a missing steering mechanism.
  No 3D solver or optimizer population is imported.
- The first two generations establish a useful separation between carrier,
  redirect, response release, and command feasibility. The transferred carrier
  formed a coherent wake but missed below after reaching `4.780L`; replacing it
  with opposite-sign static posture turns produced weak-wake upper exits, one
  with `78.0%` posterior angle-limit exposure. Preserving the carrier while
  shifting its oscillator centers into the sampled same-sign, body-frame-error-
  gated C-bend instead captured at `25.388T` (mean distance `2.557L`). On that
  same capture topology, response-triggered bend release independently improved
  arrival to `25.152T` and mean distance to `2.522L`, while a component-wise
  smooth acceleration projection improved them further to `23.997T` and
  `2.438L` and kept recorded raw commands below `31.42 rad/T^2`. Therefore
  preserve the successful bend polarity and carrier, and treat response release
  and final command projection as compatible but distinct control layers rather
  than cadence gains or wholesale posture replacement. Applicability is limited
  to the present joint/observation conventions and sampled still-water pose;
  projection alone did not reduce all kinematic symptoms (`4.5%` posterior
  velocity-cap exposure and `2.922 rad/T` peak yaw), so falsify a combined design
  if capture/wake coherence regresses or joint/yaw histories worsen despite
  bounded acceleration.
- Terminal posterior wave-shape tests now expose a tradeoff rather than a route
  improvement. All sampled and assigned-parent policies preserve the same
  coherent alternating top-down/oblique wake and capture topology. Relative to
  the v24 continuous body-frame course brake (`23.8315T`, mean distance
  `2.434073L`, peak/inside-`3L` yaw `3.208/1.684 rad/T`), the inherited v27
  half-cycle phase-lag modulation lowers yaw to `2.925/1.584 rad/T` but slows
  capture to `23.9250T` and worsens mean distance to `2.434841L`; its joint-speed
  cap exposure remains `11.56%/4.67%` (`14.32%/5.77%` above 99% of cap). The
  sampled v29 posterior counter-tangent moves the opposite way: capture
  improves slightly to
  `23.7930T` and mean distance to `2.433953L`, but yaw rises to
  `3.289/1.706 rad/T`, peak moment coefficient rises from `0.01409` to
  `0.01512`, speed-cap exposure remains `11.60%/4.53%`, and scalar score is
  slightly worse. Earlier hard sign consensus and yaw-selected curvature also
  left the visible approach unchanged. Do not repeat terminal lag, tangent, or
  cue-sign tuning as though it will remove the common actuator symptom: every
  diagnostic trace reaches the exact `4.537856 rad/T` speed envelope while
  projected commands repeatedly approach the acceleration envelope. Preserve
  the captured target-course carrier and next distinguish outward energy
  injection from braking with normalized joint-state feedback. This lesson is
  limited to the direct-uniform still-water carrier and is falsified if such a
  state-aware mechanism fails to reduce cap occupancy, or if it reduces
  occupancy only by delaying capture, weakening the wake, or worsening yaw and
  loads.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect both top-down and oblique 3D keyframe rows before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination. A prewarm
  artifact is a contract failure in this direct-uniform experiment.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Inflow, target position, initial pose,
  and hydrodynamic conditions are intended held-out axes; coordinate
  memorization is not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
