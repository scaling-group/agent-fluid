# Dogfish L64 3D Moving-Window Still-Water Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 10-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. Its logical Phase-2 population is always four workers even when the
  four CFD evaluations are mapped across different PBS/GPU allocations.
- The fixed task is WaterLily 3D at `L64`, `Re=1000`, target `(9,9.5)L`,
  first-crossing radius `0.75L`, still water `U_infinity=0`, direct uniform
  initialization without prewarm, released horizon `100T`, a `24L x 16L`
  inertial virtual field stored in a `4L x 3L x 1.5L` moving window, and the
  actuator envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- This lineage starts from the transferred 2D clean-B iteration-20 champion.
  It contains target-aware feedback; evaluate its actual 3D performance rather
  than assuming either successful transfer or a missing steering mechanism.
  No 3D solver or optimizer population is imported.
- Do not transfer a learned 2D curvature sign as if it were a geometric
  invariant. In the direct-uniform L64 3D parent, the traveling-wave carrier
  produced a coherent alternating wake and reduced distance from `12.33L` to
  `4.78L`, but a negative body-frame target request was mapped to positive
  posterior mean curvature. After the target passed behind, measured mean tail
  tangent stayed positive (`8.2 deg` over `20--25T`) while yaw increased by
  `42.7 deg`; the fish moved another `3.68L` toward the lower boundary and
  terminated `left_domain` at `27.49T`. Infer actuator polarity from the
  measured 3D course response, and prefer a bounded odd target-to-curvature map
  before adding direction-specific recovery branches. Falsify that implication
  if reversing the map fails to contract signed target bearing or instead
  degrades the coherent wake and forward progress; that new rollout must decide
  whether authority, saturation, or another mechanism is the remaining fault.
- Preserve the direction-selective rate governor after the odd-curvature route
  captures: versus the matching clamped controller it retained the coherent
  wake, improved score from `-0.5152775` to `-0.5127478`, shortened path from
  `13.4189L` to `13.3177L`, and eliminated sampled `99.9%` rate-limit residence.
  Do not infer from the remaining acceleration-ceiling residence that more
  upstream energy attenuation is beneficial. Three distinct completed tests
  retained capture but all worsened score: cadence-boost withdrawal delayed
  arrival by `0.3795T` and raised mean score-distance to `2.421103L`; a smooth
  speed-increasing command envelope cut ceiling residence from `69.61/50.68%`
  to `53.59/35.17%` yet delayed arrival by `0.2200T`, lengthened path to
  `13.4414L`, and scored `-0.5338099`; phase-load gating and shared velocity
  damping scored `-0.5331201` and `-0.5300411`. For this direct-uniform captured
  gait, avoid further soft gates or cadence scalars unless new evidence ties
  saturation to a load or termination defect; test route-level errors while
  preserving propulsion and braking/reversal authority. Falsify this boundary
  if a held-out flow or route needs effort shaping to retain capture, reduce
  damaging loads, or preserve the alternating wake.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect both top-down and oblique 3D keyframe rows before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination. A prewarm
  artifact is a contract failure in this direct-uniform experiment.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Inflow, target position, initial pose,
  and hydrodynamic conditions are intended held-out axes; coordinate
  memorization is not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
