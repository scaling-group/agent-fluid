# Dogfish L64 3D Moving-Window Still-Water Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 10-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. Its logical Phase-2 population is always four workers even when the
  four CFD evaluations are mapped across different PBS/GPU allocations.
- The fixed task is WaterLily 3D at `L64`, `Re=1000`, target `(9,9.5)L`,
  first-crossing radius `0.75L`, still water `U_infinity=0`, direct uniform
  initialization without prewarm, released horizon `100T`, a `24L x 16L`
  inertial virtual field stored in a `4L x 3L x 1.5L` moving window, and the
  actuator envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- This lineage starts from the transferred 2D clean-B iteration-20 champion.
  It contains target-aware feedback; evaluate its actual 3D performance rather
  than assuming either successful transfer or a missing steering mechanism.
  No 3D solver or optimizer population is imported.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- The far-field response-release hypothesis has a concrete negative result in
  direct-uniform still water.  Relative to the transferred seed, gating only
  geometric steering when measured yaw had the requested sign changed minimum
  and final distance from `4.780/9.709L` to `4.660/9.604L`, but preserved the
  lower-boundary exit, roughly `98%` exposure to at least one raw acceleration
  command above the actuator envelope, and essentially the same thresholded
  yaw-reversal count (82 versus 84).  The evaluator's seven-sample
  `turn_rate_recent` window spans only about `0.0385T`, so it is dominated by
  within-beat rotation and must not be treated as a route-scale response signal
  or repaired by another release-gain tweak.  Preserve the coherent carrier
  and deep early approach, but test steering authority upstream of clipping.
  Do not replace the carrier wholesale: a corrected-sign `12 deg` static mean
  curvature reached only `12.206L` before an upper exit, while the assigned
  parent's globally slower, soft-limited progress redirect removed raw
  acceleration exceedance but degraded closest approach to `8.752L` and also
  exited above.  The inherited course-response experiment closes an important
  loophole: even an initial negative tail-tangent bias below `0.5 deg`, released
  and reversed using measured swimming direction, reached only `12.083L` and
  exited above at `8.618T`.  Thus correct actuator polarity or course alignment
  alone does not make an always-on mean bend safe at the release pose.  In this
  direct-uniform, fixed-initial-joint regime, keep the demonstrated carrier and
  leave mean curvature dormant near the initial centerline.  The completed
  materially off-axis wrong-polarity veto now closes the release-only branch:
  relative to the response-release child it improved minimum distance from
  `4.660L` to `4.141L` and delayed the lower exit from `28.369T` to `32.197T`,
  but still finished at `9.570L` through the same lower boundary with a
  coherent unrecovered diagonal wake.  Thus geometric withdrawal can preserve
  and modestly extend the useful approach, but another veto threshold or
  release gain is unlikely to supply route-scale turning.  The subsequent
  opposing-only phase allocation is a positive semantic result: it preserves
  the coherent carrier, improves the closest pass from `4.141L` to `3.033L`,
  reduces raw acceleration-envelope exposure from `98.09%` to `93.63%`, and
  changes the lower exit into a longer left-boundary trajectory.  Retain this
  upstream-of-clipping allocation rather than returning to scalar release
  tuning.  Its three sampled continuations sharpen the remaining boundary.
  Persistent geometry-driven phase relief and a `3 deg` near-abeam posterior
  bend both leave the approximately `3L` pass and left exit essentially
  unchanged (`2.999/8.965L` and `3.035/8.999L` minimum/final distance).  A
  stronger `7 deg` bend armed only after passage does produce a genuine
  hairpin, delays exit from `40.331T` to `49.319T`, and improves final distance
  from `9.314L` to `7.528L` without raising peak raw acceleration, but the
  closest pass remains `3.031L`, the target stays behind and strongly lateral,
  and the fish exits above.  Thus posterior curvature has sufficient route-
  scale authority, but spending it only at or after abeam is too late for
  interception.  Keep mean bend dormant near the initial centerline and next
  test smooth pre-abeam arming from normalized forward/lateral target geometry
  with release on lateral alignment.  Avoid another post-passage gain or mild
  abeam threshold.  This lesson applies while the evidenced carrier and
  release-pose regime are retained; falsify it if a geometry-gated pre-abeam
  maneuver loses early progress or wake coherence, or if a post-passage-only
  controller actually reacquires the target and improves termination.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect both top-down and oblique 3D keyframe rows before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination. A prewarm
  artifact is a contract failure in this direct-uniform experiment.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Inflow, target position, initial pose,
  and hydrodynamic conditions are intended held-out axes; coordinate
  memorization is not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
