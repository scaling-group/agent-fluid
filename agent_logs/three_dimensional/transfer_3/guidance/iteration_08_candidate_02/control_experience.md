# Dogfish L64 3D Moving-Window Still-Water Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 40-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. Its logical Phase-2 population is always four workers even when the
  four CFD evaluations are mapped across different PBS/GPU allocations.
- The fixed task is WaterLily 3D at `L64`, `Re=1000`, target `(9,9.5)L`,
  first-crossing radius `0.75L`, still water `U_infinity=0`, direct uniform
  initialization without prewarm, released horizon `100T`, a `24L x 16L`
  inertial virtual field stored in a `4L x 3L x 1.5L` moving window, and the
  actuator envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive seed has only a state-feedback oscillator and posterior
  phase lag. It reads joint state but not the task target, flow, force, moment,
  world position, learned route, or any external phase signal, and it is not
  intended to complete the task.
- Steering polarity is necessary but not sufficient in a cross-dimensional
  port. The coherent clean-B carrier reached `6.138L` before wrong-sign yaw
  caused a lower exit, but two correct-sign posterior mean-curvature variants
  also failed: a yaw-rate loop reached `9.175L` and a static `4 deg` bias only
  `11.878L`, both crossing the target line and growing roughly `1.3 rad` of
  opposite-side bearing before upper exits. The nominally envelope-safe
  half-cycle carrier produced a visibly weaker wake and reached only
  `12.165L`. Moreover, `turn_rate_recent` spans seven integration samples
  (about `0.0385T`, not a `0.55T` beat average) and oscillates near
  `+/-2 rad/T`, so high-gain feedback on it does not establish yaw braking.
  Preserve a coherent carrier while testing a bounded geometry-response
  release or a genuinely beat-scale response signal; avoid treating static
  correct-sign bias or this sub-beat rate as complete pursuit. This applies
  when local flow is small (`about 0.02--0.03U`) and route overshoot dominates;
  falsify it if response-led release reduces neither boundary bearing nor
  route loss despite retaining propulsion, which would implicate actuator
  authority or carrier-induced yaw rather than release semantics.
- Heading alignment is not route alignment, but completed evidence now rejects
  both sampled instantaneous-course release and posterior half-cycle strength
  as complete fixes under this carrier. Low-speed-gated course and raw-slip
  candidates improve closest approach from the phase-conditioned reference's
  `5.658L` to `4.358L` and `4.158L`, yet pass the target's x station and exit
  left at final distances `9.767L` and `9.037L`. The fixed projection
  `v_y_slow = v_y + 0.11*phi_dot1 - 0.035*phi_dot2` reduces body-lateral RMS
  from `0.269--0.385U` to `0.086--0.140U`, but its mean-curvature rollout still
  reaches only `4.128L` and repeats the left exit at `9.051L`. Giving the full
  signed projected-course error to that loop worsens the result to an upper
  exit at `11.30T` and `8.507L`; giving projected course directly to half-cycle
  strength reaches only `11.994L` before an `8.66T` upper exit. Most
  decisively, adding projected-yaw response damping to half-cycle strength
  curls near the start, exits at `8.70T`, and never gets closer than `12.072L`.
  Preserve the recoil projection only as an observation transform; avoid more
  gain tuning of instantaneous course-to-mean-curvature or response-damped
  half-cycle strength. In still water with small local flow, test a route
  response that does not divide beat-contaminated velocity components, such as
  range-normalized inertial line-of-sight rotation, or obtain genuinely
  beat-scale history. Falsify the response-signal alternative if it retains
  either the short upper exit or the more-than-`4L` high left pass despite a
  coherent wake; that would implicate posterior-curvature authority and favor
  a bounded wave-shape/phase actuator rather than another algebraic signal.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect both top-down and oblique 3D keyframe rows before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination. A prewarm
  artifact is a contract failure in this direct-uniform experiment.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Inflow, target position, initial pose,
  and hydrodynamic conditions are intended held-out axes; coordinate
  memorization is not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
