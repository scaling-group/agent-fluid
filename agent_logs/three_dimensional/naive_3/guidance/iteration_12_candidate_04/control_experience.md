# Dogfish L64 3D Moving-Window Still-Water Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 40-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. Its logical Phase-2 population is always four workers even when the
  four CFD evaluations are mapped across different PBS/GPU allocations.
- The fixed task is WaterLily 3D at `L64`, `Re=1000`, target `(9,9.5)L`,
  first-crossing radius `0.75L`, still water `U_infinity=0`, direct uniform
  initialization without prewarm, released horizon `100T`, a `24L x 16L`
  inertial virtual field stored in a `4L x 3L x 1.5L` moving window, and the
  actuator envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive oscillator/posterior-lag carrier is already self-propelling
  in direct-uniform still water, but that does not establish useful navigation:
  the sampled seed traveled about `1.52L` with a coherent 3D wake yet improved
  target distance by only `0.258L`, accumulated `1.252 rad` heading error, and
  exited the upper boundary at `8.602T`. When this zero-steering topology
  recurs, test bounded body-frame target-error-to-mean-curvature feedback while
  preserving the lagged carrier before changing scalar drive gains. This
  implication applies only when the wake and displacement confirm propulsion;
  a wrong-sign turn, lost wake coherence, or worse actuator-limit residence
  falsifies the curvature sign or joint split and should be corrected before
  adding flow or force compensation.
- Once restrained target-relative curvature establishes a coherent approach,
  preserve its cruise scaffold and diagnose the near miss by relative geometry
  and motion rather than proximity alone. In the completed samples, posterior
  bearing gating improved closest approach from `4.067L` (plain `7 deg`
  curvature) and `3.587L` (toward-bend half-cycle boost) to `2.443L`, with a
  coherent wake and survival to `31.097T`. Across the three closest sampled
  approaches, median closing response fell consistently from about
  `0.586--0.606 L/T` between `3--4L` to `0.131--0.163 L/T` inside `2.7L`; at
  the best minimum the full body-frame direction error was about `1.42 rad`
  while translational speed remained about `0.669 U`, after which the fish
  receded to a lower-boundary exit. A distance-only energy envelope (`2.845L`),
  full-direction posterior gating alone (`2.494L`), and away-half-cycle braking
  (`2.501L`) all preserved that topology. Two inherited attempts to repair the
  course earlier also failed: matched-window target-ray lead worsened minimum
  and mean distance from `2.443/8.443L` to `3.167/8.602L`, and an earlier
  wrong-side lateral-velocity posterior guard reached only `2.697L`; both
  retained the powered lower exit. Direct sideslip-to-curvature feedback was
  worse still, reversing the useful release into an upper exit with only
  `12.150L` closest approach. Later completed evidence nevertheless separates
  posterior sign and persistence: a sampled `7 deg` opposite-sign posterior
  counterbend improved minimum distance from `2.443L` to `2.187L`, kept mean
  distance nearly unchanged (`8.446L` versus `8.443L`), and preserved the long
  coherent wake, whereas the assigned parent's approach-localized same-sign
  response-gated posterior redirect reached only `2.601L`; both still exited
  low. In the `2.187L` trace, its instantaneous lateral-velocity gate exceeded
  `0.05` on only `57%` of samples inside `3L` and repeatedly released while
  normalized lateral target error remained `0.7--1.0`. The next sampled
  comparisons close that tail-only branch: a geometry-persistent counterbend
  reached `2.477L`, a head-closure and bearing-response-released opposite-sign
  S-bend reached `2.536L`, and a cross-track/closure-gated posterior-wave hold
  reached `2.429L` versus the carrier's `2.443L` while worsening mean distance
  from `8.443L` to `8.454L`. Along with full-direction posterior gating at
  `2.494L`, every variant kept the same coherent wake and powered lower exit.
  Since the carrier already clamped anterior/posterior acceleration for about
  `0.746/0.354` of its samples, avoid more scalar relief, isolated half-cycle
  effort, persistent early line-of-sight/slip correction, or repackaging
  distance, closure, bearing-response, and posterior-sign gates around another
  small tail-only residual. If a burst-redirect primitive is tested next, it
  must materially change maneuver allocation by damping the propulsive rhythm
  and engaging the anterior as well as posterior equilibrium, then release on
  measured geometric correction; it is not evidence-backed gain tuning. This
  negative implication applies to coherent, powered lateral near misses and is
  falsified by a later tail-only capture or useful new termination; any
  whole-body test is itself falsified by degraded cruise, a short-wake tight
  curl, increased clamp/load residence, or the unchanged lower exit without a
  useful minimum or integral improvement.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect both top-down and oblique 3D keyframe rows before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination. A prewarm
  artifact is a contract failure in this direct-uniform experiment.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Inflow, target position, initial pose,
  and hydrodynamic conditions are intended held-out axes; coordinate
  memorization is not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
