# Dogfish L64 3D Moving-Window Still-Water Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 40-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. Its logical Phase-2 population is always four workers even when the
  four CFD evaluations are mapped across different PBS/GPU allocations.
- The fixed task is WaterLily 3D at `L64`, `Re=1000`, target `(9,9.5)L`,
  first-crossing radius `0.75L`, still water `U_infinity=0`, direct uniform
  initialization without prewarm, released horizon `100T`, a `24L x 16L`
  inertial virtual field stored in a `4L x 3L x 1.5L` moving window, and the
  actuator envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive oscillator/posterior-lag carrier is already self-propelling
  in direct-uniform still water, but that does not establish useful navigation:
  the sampled seed traveled about `1.52L` with a coherent 3D wake yet improved
  target distance by only `0.258L`, accumulated `1.252 rad` heading error, and
  exited the upper boundary at `8.602T`. When this zero-steering topology
  recurs, test bounded body-frame target-error-to-mean-curvature feedback while
  preserving the lagged carrier before changing scalar drive gains. This
  implication applies only when the wake and displacement confirm propulsion;
  a wrong-sign turn, lost wake coherence, or worse actuator-limit residence
  falsifies the curvature sign or joint split and should be corrected before
  adding flow or force compensation.
- Once restrained target-relative curvature establishes a coherent approach,
  preserve its cruise scaffold and diagnose the near miss by relative geometry
  and motion rather than proximity alone. In the completed samples, posterior
  bearing gating improved closest approach from `4.067L` (plain `7 deg`
  curvature) and `3.587L` (toward-bend half-cycle boost) to `2.443L`, with a
  coherent wake and survival to `31.097T`. Across the three closest sampled
  approaches, median closing response fell consistently from about
  `0.586--0.606 L/T` between `3--4L` to `0.131--0.163 L/T` inside `2.7L`; at
  the best minimum the full body-frame direction error was about `1.42 rad`
  while translational speed remained about `0.669 U`, after which the fish
  receded to a lower-boundary exit. A distance-only energy envelope (`2.845L`),
  full-direction posterior gating alone (`2.494L`), and away-half-cycle braking
  (`2.501L`) all preserved that topology. Two inherited attempts to repair the
  course earlier also failed: matched-window target-ray lead worsened minimum
  and mean distance from `2.443/8.443L` to `3.167/8.602L`, and an earlier
  wrong-side lateral-velocity posterior guard reached only `2.697L`; both
  retained the powered lower exit. Direct sideslip-to-curvature feedback was
  worse still, reversing the useful release into an upper exit with only
  `12.150L` closest approach. Later evidence shows that posterior sign was a
  useful but non-general isolated result: a velocity-gated opposite-sign
  counterbend reached `2.187L`, but making that equilibrium persist with
  lateral target geometry regressed to `2.477L`; a later response-released
  opposite-sign S-bend reached only `2.536L` versus the carrier's `2.443L`.
  Both retained the coherent wake and powered lower exit. Symmetric
  cross-track/closure attenuation of the posterior wave was also nearly null:
  it reached `2.429L`, just `0.014L` closer, worsened mean distance from
  `8.443L` to `8.454L`, and kept the same termination. Thus do not infer that
  more persistence, another redirect threshold, extra signal conjunctions, or
  beat-symmetric drive relief will complete this approach. This implication is
  limited to the coherent powered-below-target topology and is falsified by a
  later capture or useful termination from one of those mechanisms.
- When static posterior allocation and beat-symmetric approach scheduling both
  preserve the same lateral near miss, inspect signed response within the beat
  before changing scalar carrier effort. At the four current sampled minima,
  full body-frame target-direction error remains `1.25--1.45 rad`, speed remains
  `0.68--0.73U`, and heading rate is `+2.00--2.46 rad/T` in the sign that grows
  the target error; anterior/posterior acceleration is already clamped for
  roughly `0.72--0.75/0.33--0.36` of samples. The reusable next discriminator
  is therefore whether posterior oscillatory authority can be reduced only on
  the measured wrong-way yaw half-cycle while preserving mean steering and the
  corrective half-cycle, not whether all terminal propulsion should be reduced.
  Apply this only to a self-propelled, wake-coherent approach with a strongly
  lateral target. Reject it on changed cruise, premature coasting, a one-sided
  or collapsed wake, a tight curl, higher posterior limit/load residence, or
  persistence of the same lower exit without a material distance improvement.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect both top-down and oblique 3D keyframe rows before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination. A prewarm
  artifact is a contract failure in this direct-uniform experiment.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Inflow, target position, initial pose,
  and hydrodynamic conditions are intended held-out axes; coordinate
  memorization is not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
