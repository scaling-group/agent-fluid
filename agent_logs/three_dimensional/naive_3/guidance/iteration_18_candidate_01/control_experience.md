# Dogfish L64 3D Moving-Window Still-Water Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 10-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. Its logical Phase-2 population is always four workers even when the
  four CFD evaluations are mapped across different PBS/GPU allocations.
- The fixed task is WaterLily 3D at `L64`, `Re=1000`, target `(9,9.5)L`,
  first-crossing radius `0.75L`, still water `U_infinity=0`, direct uniform
  initialization without prewarm, released horizon `100T`, a `24L x 16L`
  inertial virtual field stored in a `4L x 3L x 1.5L` moving window, and the
  actuator envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive seed has only a state-feedback oscillator and posterior
  phase lag. It reads joint state but not the task target, flow, force, moment,
  world position, learned route, or any external phase signal, and it is not
  intended to complete the task.
- In the sampled direct-still-water seed rollout, the lagged carrier formed a
  coherent 3D wake and reached `0.636U`, but target bearing swept from roughly
  `+0.19` through zero to `-1.44 rad`; best progress was only `0.250L` before
  an upper-boundary exit at `8.547T`. Raw joint-acceleration commands also
  exceeded the actuator envelope in about one third of samples. Treat this
  topology as missing target-relative steering, not evidence for more drive:
  preserve the useful traveling bend and test bounded body-frame curvature
  before increasing carrier gains. Falsify that implication if curvature
  feedback destroys wake coherence, materially increases saturation, or does
  not improve bearing containment, progress, or termination class.
- The first four direct-uniform still-water target-feedback rollouts sharpen
  that seed lesson. Three posterior mean-curvature variants preserved coherent
  propulsion and improved closest distance to `9.141L`, `11.642L`, and
  `11.824L`, yet all crossed into diverging negative bearing and exited the
  upper boundary by `13.129T`; changing curvature cap, bearing scale, trend
  lead, or instantaneous yaw-rate feedback did not improve termination class.
  A fourth variant moved both joint centers, limited the anterior oscillation
  to about `8 deg`, and worsened final distance to `13.403L`, despite avoiding
  raw acceleration clipping. For this carrier, do not treat static-offset gain
  tuning as course recovery and do not shift the anterior oscillator center
  without separate evidence that thrust survives. When a posterior offset
  retains progress but cannot reverse the post-crossing yaw, test a different
  phase-aware actuator primitive such as bounded half-cycle asymmetry or mild
  lag modulation. Reconsider this boundary only if such a controller loses
  wake coherence or a static offset later demonstrates bearing recovery and a
  better termination class without increased limit occupancy.
- The later sampled and inherited sequence separates target approach from
  corrective work. The unrelieved bearing-minus-slip carrier reached
  `2.960L`, while distance-conditioned posterior relief and carrier-wide hold
  worsened closest approach to `3.162L` and `3.592L`; a static full-quadrant
  redirect and an instantaneous-yaw-gated anterior redirect recovered only
  `2.999L` and `2.989L`. An additional inherited continuation reached
  `2.986L`, yet every case still exited the upper boundary. The visual sheets
  and trajectories show a coherent, self-propelled alternating wake during
  approach, followed by nearly fixed joints during the held redirects; local
  flow stayed far below swimming speed, so the common pass-and-hook is not
  passive still-water advection. Full-quadrant geometry is necessary after a
  pass, but neither distance relief, a held center shift, nor beat-contaminated
  instantaneous yaw gating supplies active course recovery. Preserve the
  zero-centered carrier and test target-signed, joint-phase-gated corrective
  work that stays rhythmic and releases with body-frame alignment. Falsify
  this implication if such asymmetry loses the alternating wake, materially
  raises limit occupancy, cannot beat the `2.960L` reference, or repeats the
  upper exit without a distinct recovery arc.
- Phase-aware steering must be judged by where it allocates corrective work,
  not by continued oscillation alone. The sampled anterior half-cycle
  stiffness variant kept an alternating 3D wake, but closest approach worsened
  to `4.859L` from the inherited unrelieved carrier's `2.960L`, peak speed fell
  from about `1.03U` to `0.95U`, applied acceleration-limit occupancy rose
  from roughly `34/45%` to `53/64%`, and termination remained the same upper
  exit. Avoid further anterior restoring-stiffness or gain asymmetry on this
  carrier; if testing phase-aware correction, place it in posterior wave
  timing or another cycle-resolved channel that leaves the zero-centered
  anterior oscillator unchanged. Falsify this boundary only if an anterior
  phase mechanism improves bearing recovery or termination class while
  preserving the `2.960L` approach and without raising limit occupancy.
- Three completed inherited posterior/recovery tests show that detecting the
  failed pass is not the same as producing corrective yaw. Posterior phase-lag
  modulation worsened closest approach to `3.532L` and raised raw
  acceleration-limit occupancy to about `56/66%`; posterior counterstroke
  relief retained a `2.978L` approach, but full bearing still diverged from
  about `-1.39 rad` near the pass to `-2.66 rad` by `24T`. A receding-gated
  distributed coil slightly improved closest distance to `2.959L`, yet it
  settled near `(-14,-20) deg`, shed little sustained corrective wake, and
  reached about `-2.71 rad` bearing before the same upper exit. Treat large
  error and target-receding motion only as gates, not as turn mechanisms, and
  avoid further held distributed bends or half-cycle selectors based on an
  unevidenced posterior-target sign. The repeatable `4--12T` carrier data give
  a sharper phase calibration: yaw-moment sign follows anterior-angle sign
  (means near `-0.0077/+0.0078`). A posterior-only cyclic allocation may use
  that observed sign to reduce the counter-moment half while leaving the
  zero-centered anterior carrier and useful half intact. Falsify this boundary
  if moment-aligned allocation degrades the broad approach, raises limit
  occupancy, loses alternating shedding, or still cannot reverse bearing or
  termination topology.
- Body-frame velocity-course error is the first inherited observation change
  to produce a semantic trajectory improvement: with the zero-centered carrier
  and `12 deg` posterior curvature unchanged, it moved the sampled/inherited
  upper-exit floor from about `2.96--2.99L` to `0.857L` and a distinct left
  exit while preserving a coherent alternating 3D wake (`1.052U` peak speed
  versus `0.031U` peak local flow). The closest pass was nearly tangent, with
  course error still about `-1.42 rad`, so bearing-minus-slip and course error
  are not interchangeable steering observations. A distance-scheduled increase
  to almost `18 deg` posterior curvature improved the miss by only `0.025L` to
  `0.832L`, while posterior excursion reached `44.3 deg` against the `45 deg`
  hard limit and raw posterior acceleration exceeded its envelope in about
  `68%` of samples. Preserve velocity-course feedback when translation is
  measurable, but do not increase posterior curvature further on this carrier;
  test terminal authority in the anterior angle margin with the yaw sign
  calibrated from rollout moments, and gate it tightly by normalized distance
  and course misalignment. Falsify this implication if the sub-`1L` approach
  is not reproducible, the alternating wake degrades, anterior limit occupancy
  rises materially, or an alternative posterior mechanism improves capture
  without approaching the angle stop.
- The next completed samples separate observation replay from actuator
  allocation. Cancelling lateral velocity with a `0.11*phi_dot1` term fitted
  to one near-miss trace regressed closest approach from the raw-course
  controller's `0.857L` to `4.459L`, reduced peak speed from about `1.05U` to
  `0.90U`, and ended at a boundary despite retaining an alternating wake; do
  not turn a single-trajectory joint-rate correlation into a course estimator
  without closed-loop evidence. In contrast, restoring raw velocity-course
  feedback and reserving `35%` of the existing posterior acceleration envelope
  for target-signed steering below `6L` produced the first sampled capture at
  `0.749826L` and `18.265T`, with a coherent top-down and oblique 3D wake and no
  raw posterior acceleration exceedance below `3L`. When carrier clipping can
  mask an already-saturated steering request, test explicit bounded sharing of
  the fixed actuator envelope before adding curvature, drive, or a fitted phase
  subtraction. The posterior angle reached the `45 deg` stop at capture, so
  the gate and reserve fraction are not general gains: require repeat capture
  and reject transfers that hit the angle stop earlier, lose the sub-`1L`
  topology, raise occupancy, or become persistently one-sided.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect both top-down and oblique 3D keyframe rows before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination. A prewarm
  artifact is a contract failure in this direct-uniform experiment.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Inflow, target position, initial pose,
  and hydrodynamic conditions are intended held-out axes; coordinate
  memorization is not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
