# Dogfish L64 Second-Row Wake-Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 40-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. The same guidance is used by matched 2-, 3-, and 4-worker runs.
- The fixed task is `L64`, target `(9,9.5)L`, first-crossing radius `0.75L`,
  inflow `0.18`, held-fish prewarm `200`, released horizon `300`, and actuator
  envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive seed has only a state-feedback oscillator and posterior
  phase lag. It reads joint state but not the task target, flow, force, moment,
  world position, learned route, or any external phase signal, and it is not
  intended to complete the task.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- The `fish-control-primitives` shelf exists for mechanism-level transfer
  across biological swimming, robotic fish, CFD, and wake-control problems.
  Transfer qualitative invariants into this lane's observations and actuation;
  never copy numerical gains, species-specific kinematics, or a memorized
  route. The worker entrypoint defines the consultation protocol.
- Inspect shared prewarm and released keyframe sheets before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination.
- Across the common prewarm state, bounded body-frame bearing-to-mean-curvature
  feedback converted the seed's `50.13`-time lower exit and `8.61L` closest
  approach into two target captures at `42.86` and `39.74` release time. The
  faster allocation expressed one `12 deg` total-curvature budget as only
  `5.4 deg` anterior and `6.6 deg` posterior center bias; an anterior-heavy
  `10/5 deg` implementation instead moved downstream, made negative progress,
  and exited after `18.68`. For this target-blind-oscillator failure topology,
  preserve the lagged traveling component and distribute a bounded target-
  signed curvature request across both joints rather than recentering primarily
  at the anterior joint. The causal boundary is the shared wake phase and the
  coupled difference between implementations: retain this lesson only while a
  held-out or repeated rollout preserves target capture, turn sign, and
  propulsion, and test saturation residence and load histories before claiming
  robustness or efficiency.
- Within the filtered-bearing scaffold, replacing a fixed `40/60` anterior/
  posterior curvature split with a bearing-magnitude schedule that approaches
  `35/65` only at large error improved capture from `35.6895` to `35.0625`,
  mean distance from `1.7619L` to `1.7339L`, and score from `0.112158` to
  `0.140088`; lateral-force RMS, moment RMS, and total command energy also fell
  from `59.28/821.23/50,871` to `56.57/793.76/50,175` with the same `12 deg`
  total-curvature limit. Prefer normalized geometry-conditioned allocation to
  increasing the steering budget when the direct traveling-wave route is
  already successful. This result is one common-phase rollout, not robustness
  evidence: retain it only if repeat or held-out wakes preserve capture and
  trajectory topology without longer saturation residence or load spikes.
- Do not interpret small wake-response magnitudes as successful disturbance
  rejection in this lane. The immediate downstream-exit failure saw only
  `0.045` RMS relative crossflow and `299` RMS moment, whereas both captures
  traversed the developed wake at `0.215-0.227` crossflow and `713-762` moment.
  Add a flow/force residual only after keyframes identify a repeatable
  target-directed trajectory that is specifically lost during wake events;
  falsify it if capture, upstream propulsion, or loads worsen.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Wake phase, inflow, cylinder layout,
  and target position are intended held-out axes; coordinate memorization is
  not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
