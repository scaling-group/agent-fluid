# Dogfish L64 Second-Row Wake-Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 40-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. The same guidance is used by matched 2-, 3-, and 4-worker runs.
- The fixed task is `L64`, target `(9,9.5)L`, first-crossing radius `0.75L`,
  inflow `0.18`, held-fish prewarm `200`, released horizon `300`, and actuator
  envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive seed has only a state-feedback oscillator and posterior
  phase lag. It reads joint state but not the task target, flow, force, moment,
  world position, learned route, or any external phase signal, and it is not
  intended to complete the task.
- Do not intensify the naive seed's `28 deg`, `0.55`-period drive. In its sampled
  rollout, nominal `A*omega` and `A*omega^2` already exceeded the `260` and
  `1800` degree-based caps, diagnostics reached both caps exactly, and the fish
  turned from `29 deg` toward `81 deg`, reached `9.01L` lateral target offset,
  and exited after `50.13` time units despite a transient `8.61L` minimum
  distance. Treat that transient approach as uncontrolled propulsion, not a
  navigation mechanism: first test a cap-feasible gait with bounded body-frame
  bearing correction. This lesson applies to oscillator settings whose
  velocity/acceleration scales exceed the envelope; falsify the proposed
  repair if cap contact or lateral ejection persists after the anterior gait is
  feasible, because posterior lag coupling or steering sign/gain is then the
  remaining suspect.
- Treat anterior shell amplitude as a narrow wake-corridor selector, not a
  monotone thrust knob. In the inherited matched `0.67`-period family with
  `0.65/0.80` posterior lag/damping and bounded negative bearing/rate steering,
  `19 deg` remained finite but missed at its `5.812L` horizon minimum, `20 deg`
  captured at `266.255`, and changing only the shell to `20.25 deg` captured at
  `244.547` while reducing mean distance from `7.218L` to `6.452L`. Four
  sampled evaluations reproduce the `20.25 deg` trajectory exactly under the
  certified prewarm, with maximum anterior acceleration `31.055 rad/time^2`
  below its `31.2` guard but already close to the `31.416` hard cap. Preserve
  the surrounding period/phasing/steering bundle and do not extrapolate
  amplitude above `20.25 deg`; fixed-prewarm replication is determinism, not
  wake-phase robustness. Falsify the local promotion on guard contact,
  later/lost capture, corridor rebound, or material load growth, then restore
  the demonstrated gait and test bounded corridor-retention feedback.
- Do not sharpen the posterior bearing response merely to shorten the broad
  visible release turn. With the `20 deg` gait held fixed, changing bearing
  scale from `0.30` to `0.28` produced a larger down/up detour, worsened mean
  distance from `7.218L` to `8.112L`, and raised RMS lateral force from `18.26`
  to `18.58`, despite a slightly earlier final crossing. Keep `0.30` for this
  control bundle and evaluate future steering probes by route integral and
  load as well as capture time; reopen proportional gain only if a controlled
  wake-phase comparison reverses this result.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- This no-Bookshelf ablation provides no cross-domain research shelf. Derive
  mechanisms only from the task contract, inherited guidance, sampled solver
  results and logs, and current rollout evidence; do not search for or
  reconstruct the omitted shelf.
- Inspect shared prewarm and released keyframe sheets before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Wake phase, inflow, cylinder layout,
  and target position are intended held-out axes; coordinate memorization is
  not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
