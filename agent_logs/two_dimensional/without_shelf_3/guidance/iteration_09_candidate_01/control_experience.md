# Dogfish L64 Second-Row Wake-Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 40-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. The same guidance is used by matched 2-, 3-, and 4-worker runs.
- The fixed task is `L64`, target `(9,9.5)L`, first-crossing radius `0.75L`,
  inflow `0.18`, held-fish prewarm `200`, released horizon `300`, and actuator
  envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive seed has only a state-feedback oscillator and posterior
  phase lag. It reads joint state but not the task target, flow, force, moment,
  world position, learned route, or any external phase signal, and it is not
  intended to complete the task.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- The target-blind seed's early leftward motion is genuine but insufficient
  propulsion evidence: it reached `8.61L` range, then its head moved
  `-13.30L` laterally and exited after `50.13` released time while mean lateral
  velocity (`-0.263`) nearly followed local flow (`-0.241`) and both joint-rate
  caps were touched. Preserve the state-encoded gait only behind bounded
  target-relative course correction, and size nominal rhythm below the hard
  velocity/acceleration limits; do not mistake a transient minimum distance or
  visible body wave for wake rejection. This lesson applies to the far-field
  domain-exit regime; it does not establish steering sign, wake-entry quality,
  or tight-radius capture until a feedback candidate is evaluated.
- Sampled target-feedback results separate a useful steering sign from a
  useful propulsion regulator. The positive-bearing angle-only oscillator was
  the sole variant with meaningful upstream travel (`-3.59L` head x, `0.259`
  progress), but it reached both acceleration caps and failed unstable with
  RMS force/moment `20024/314391`. Two full-orbit radial regulators stayed
  finite and low-load yet almost followed local flow and moved about `+2.25L`
  downstream. A later angle-only parent bundled a slower period, lower steering
  limit, `34 deg`/`200 deg/time` guards, and a `1600 deg/time^2` bound: it
  survived `63.55` time but moved its head `(+0.43,+1.80)L`, lost progress, and
  exited upward. Its joint-one speed reached `227 deg/time` and action reached
  `1557 deg/time^2`, so the nominally localized protection was active and the
  bundle did not preserve the useful orbit. In the far-field regime, neither
  full-orbit regulation nor simultaneously retuning gait, steering, and guards
  is supported. Isolate terminal protection against the exact progress gait,
  with thresholds above its nominal anterior `27.6 deg`/`184 deg/time` orbit
  and sampled `32.1 deg` posterior maximum but below its measured joint-one
  `38.1 deg`/`260 deg/time` failure excursion; reject this lesson if that
  controlled ablation still loses upstream relative motion or repeats the
  folded-body load event.
- Treat scalar shaping around the guarded `0.04` damping, `0.60` bearing gain,
  and `12 deg` ceiling as a closed negative neighborhood before wake entry.
  That anchor gave the strongest finite sample (`-4.08L` head x, `6.71L`
  minimum range, RMS force/moment `66.5/958`), but every close scalar edit
  retained the upper U-turn: a range-gated increase toward `0.06` moved only
  `-2.48L`; uniform `0.0425` moved `-1.93L`; `10 deg` and `14 deg` ceilings
  moved `-1.43L` and `-2.46L`; and a smooth large-bearing proportional rolloff
  moved only `-0.50L` with negative progress. These finite variants all ended
  near `+1.77` to `+1.81L` head-y displacement while close descendants kept
  similar joint extrema, so guard activation does not explain the common
  course topology. Uniform `0.05` was not a safe interpolation either: after
  reaching `6.83L` it made a full lower return, moved `(+0.33,-13.31)L`, and
  nearly followed local crossflow. Avoid further ceiling, derivative-gain,
  distance-gate, or large-bearing-amplitude interpolation in this far-field
  regime; preserve the anchor and isolate a structural change such as jointwise
  steering distribution. Falsify this boundary only if such a one-variable
  structural test cannot preserve meaningful negative x, or if a later finite
  rollout reaches the wake corridor and exposes a distinct rate-driven failure.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- This no-Bookshelf ablation provides no cross-domain research shelf. Derive
  mechanisms only from the task contract, inherited guidance, sampled solver
  results and logs, and current rollout evidence; do not search for or
  reconstruct the omitted shelf.
- Inspect shared prewarm and released keyframe sheets before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Wake phase, inflow, cylinder layout,
  and target position are intended held-out axes; coordinate memorization is
  not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
