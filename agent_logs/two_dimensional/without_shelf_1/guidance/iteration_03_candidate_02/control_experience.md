# Dogfish L64 Second-Row Wake-Policy Experience

## Persistence contract

This file is mutable optimizer state, not a static task description. Every
successful worker must leave it with at least one material, evidence-backed
lesson added or revised from its assigned parent. Distill sampled solver results
and available inherited logs into a reusable control implication plus an
applicability or falsification boundary. When prior evidence shows no
improvement, record the concrete negative result and what later workers should
avoid or test; do not use a generic no-progress sentence or a cosmetic or
identifier-only change. The current worker's new CFD evaluation occurs after
it exits and therefore becomes evidence for a later sampled worker.

- This is a fresh 40-iteration lineage with no solver or optimizer population
  import. The same guidance is used by matched 2-, 3-, and 4-worker runs.
- The fixed task is `L64`, target `(9,9.5)L`, first-crossing radius `0.75L`,
  inflow `0.18`, held-fish prewarm `200`, released horizon `300`, and actuator
  envelope `45/260/1800` in degree-based units.
- The common naive seed has only a state-feedback oscillator and posterior
  phase lag. It reads joint state but not the task target, flow, force, moment,
  world position, learned route, or any external phase signal, and it is not
  intended to complete the task.
- Inspect the seed rollout, diagnostics, available observations, and inherited
  evidence to determine what capability is missing. Preserve behavior that the
  evidence shows is useful.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback changes that are bounded and carry a
  falsifiable expectation. Let evidence choose the observation and mechanism;
  do not hard-code a global-direction command, coordinates, target identity,
  elapsed time, step count, iteration number, or a case-specific route.
- This no-Bookshelf ablation provides no cross-domain research shelf. Derive
  mechanisms only from the task contract, inherited guidance, sampled solver
  results and logs, and current rollout evidence; do not search for or
  reconstruct the omitted shelf.
- Inspect shared prewarm and released keyframe sheets before policy edits, then
  cross-check visual claims against distance progress, local/relative flow,
  force, moment, joint state, previous action, and termination.
- Prefer normalized body-frame feedback. Wake phase, inflow, cylinder layout,
  and target position are intended held-out axes; coordinate memorization is
  not a valid solution.
- Treat every proposed observation as an empirical hypothesis: establish its
  scale, convention, and measurable effect from the current evidence before
  relying on it.
- Compare successful, near-miss, and failed trajectories without assuming a
  particular causal decomposition in advance.
- Do not rank successful policies by scalar score alone. Compare semantic
  success, arrival, distance integral, final/mean distance, clearance,
  saturation, switching, effort, and force/moment loads.
- The hard limits are an actuation envelope, not a muscle-power model. Reject
  persistent bang-bang action, implausible load spikes, and fragile success
  even when scalar score improves.
- Record candidate-specific hypotheses under `logs/optimize/`; every successful
  worker must update this file with a durable lesson that should survive across
  later iterations.
- Retain the positive bearing-to-posterior-tail sign as the current finite
  anchor, but do not treat proportional steering or actuator saturation as
  solved. Relative to the saturated target-blind seed, the sampled
  `0.90`-period, positive `10 deg` tail-bias policy survived `73.39` versus
  `50.13` release units, improved progress from `0.024` to `0.132`, and reduced
  minimum distance from `8.61L` to `6.34L`; its near-zero mean local flow and
  upstream head velocity show useful self-propulsion. Yet it then made a broad
  upward loop, reached the posterior angle limit and both rate/command limits,
  and raised RMS force/moment to `196/2014`. A negative-sign, `1.10`-period,
  `11 deg` comparison instead moved `2.45L` downstream and exited after
  `17.26` units, while shifting the steering equilibrium into the anterior
  oscillator produced a curled unstable failure within `3.39` units and loads
  above `5e4/5e5`. Therefore the next reusable repair should keep steering
  out of the propulsion oscillator and test bounded rate damping around the
  positive posterior-only mechanism before reversing its sign or increasing
  all gains together. If a later candidate removes upstream progress after
  damping the loop, restore drive strength first and vary rate lead separately;
  the anterior-oscillator shift remains a negative boundary, not a promising
  fallback.
- Do not treat low loads from a globally weakened gait as successful
  desaturation.  A sampled posterior-only policy kept the positive bearing
  sign but simultaneously changed the finite anchor from `0.90`/`28 deg` to
  `1.10`/`14 deg`, reduced lag, increased damping, and capped acceleration at
  `16 rad/time^2`; although RMS force/moment fell from `196/2014` to `15/387`,
  it moved `2.45L` downstream, never improved on the initial `12.42L` target
  distance, and exited after `19.22` units.  Preserve the stronger upstream
  gait while isolating bounded posterior steering-rate damping.  This lesson
  is falsified if a rate-only change still loses upstream displacement; in
  that case restore the prior static steering ceiling first and test the rate
  sign or scale separately rather than weakening period and amplitude
  together.
